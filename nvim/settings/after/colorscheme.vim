" This file exists under after/ folder because some colorschemes (like
" gruvbox, for example) can take some global configuration options and hence
" they need to be set before choosing the colorscheme.
" So we make sure to only switch on the colorscheme below after we're sure
" it's preconfigured as desidered (under the settings/ folder)
colorscheme gruvbox
